### üìå Summary: React Native App Optimization and Refactoring

We significantly enhanced the **performance** and **maintainability** of the React Native app through:

---

### ‚úÖ **Key Improvements**

#### 1. **Performance Optimization**

* **Reduced bundle size** by removing `console.log` from production builds.
* **Optimized rendering** with `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `getItemLayout` for smoother UI and faster scrolling.
* **More efficient data fetching** by replacing a manual in-memory cache with React Query.

#### 2. **Modernized Data Fetching with React Query**

* **Cleaner, simpler components** by removing manual state and fetch logic.
* **Built-in caching & revalidation**, keeping data fresh automatically.
* **Better UX** with features like background refetching and stale-while-revalidate.
* **Simplified mutations** using `useMutation` for actions like sign-up and plan subscription.

### 3. **Callback Memoization**

* **What:** Avoided re-creating functions on every render.
* **How:** Used `useCallback` for handlers like `handleCategorySelect`, `handleCoursePressed`, etc., especially when passed as props.

### 4. **FlatList Performance**

* **What:** Improved scroll performance for `FlatList` components.
* **How:** Added `getItemLayout` to `FlatList` in `home.jsx` for faster item measurement and rendering.

### 5. **API Response Caching**

* **What:** Reduced redundant API calls.
* **How:** Implemented a basic in-memory cache in `apiService.js` for GET requests, cleared on user logout.

### üß† Final Outcome

The app is now faster, more scalable, and easier to maintain. These improvements lay a strong foundation for future features and long-term growth.
